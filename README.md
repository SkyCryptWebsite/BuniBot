# BuniBot
![Node.js CI](https://github.com/SkyCryptWebsite/BuniBot/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

BuniBot is a Discord bot made for the SkyCrypt Community. It is not currently optimized to run yourself, for now use the bot in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/Dk25bnB). This bot borrows some code, images, and ideas from [skyflower](https://github.com/LeaPhant/skyflower).

### Installation

BuniBot requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ to run.

Change `src/data/sensitive-example.toml` to `src/data/sensitive-example.toml` and replace with your details.

Install the dependencies and run.

```sh
$ npm ci
$ npm run start
```
### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Just fork the repository and write a PR to have one of our developers look over the code!
